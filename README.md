For my Intro to Software Engineering course, my team and I created a Employee Database that helps keep track of employees
as well as other functions. Some of the features that made include keeping
track of hours, calculating pay, and general employee maintenance tasks. The main languages we chose to was php, html, sql, and css. We mainly used php
and implemented html within the php file and used sql queries to grab records from
tables, while css was used for the design of the website.
